# DeadAuthor
based on Roland Barthes "The Death of the Author"

In the following experiment, an attempt is made to address the possibility that object-oriented ontology may indeed exist and may even be autonomous in the sense that it may possess a sentient logic that is similar, compatible, or alternative to that of humans. The experiment involves a dialectic interaction between a human and an “object”. Object is defined here as a none living entity that possesses a mechanism for processing information that does not involve organic-life intervention. In other words, a human poses a statement, and the system responds. In our case, we start with the following sentence: “If you can think of it, it exists”.  In this case, we select the  words “I”, “you”, “exists”, “can think of”, “it” (yet, we use the Chinese characters 我", "你", "它", "是", "想" for simplicity).
